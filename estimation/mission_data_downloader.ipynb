This table is constructed based on the [Cassini Titan Gravity Science Table](https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini/RSS%20PDS%20page%202019-01-23/rss/TI_12.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Define the name of your `custom_input_mission`;\n",
    "2) Add a `custom_ck_url` (namely, the NAIF link where ck kernels for the mission are stored);\n",
    "3) Define a `placeholders` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "      ***IMPORTANT!***\n",
    "   \n",
    "      *`placeholders` is a list containing the single pieces that make up a \"template filename\", selected by the user.\n",

    "      *The `placeholders` list defines the keys to a vocabulary, plus the underscores positions.*\n",

    "      *version = v01,*\n",
    "      *extension = bc*\n",

    "      \n",
    "      *also encoding the underscores positions.*\n",
    "      \n",
    "5) Create the pattern corresponding to the `placeholders` list;\n",
    "6) Add the corresponding pattern to the list of supported patterns;\n",
    "7) Define the `custom_local_path`  where you want to store your data;\n",
    "8) Call the `get_mission_files` function as done for other missions already, and do not forget the **flag**: `all_meta_kernel_files`.\n",
    "9) Specify the start and end date\n",
