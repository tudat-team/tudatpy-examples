    "5) Create the pattern corresponding to the `placeholders` list;\n",
    "6) Add the corresponding pattern to the list of supported patterns;\n",
    "7) Define the `custom_local_path`  where you want to store your data;\n",
    "8) Call the `get_mission_files` function as done for other missions already, and do not forget the **flag**: `all_meta_kernel_files`.\n",
