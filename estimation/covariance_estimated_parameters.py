# Covariance Analysis with DELFI-C3
## Objectives
This example will guide you through the set-up of an orbit estimation routine, which usually comprises the **estimation of the covariance**, as well as the **estimation of the initial parameters**. In this example we will **focus on the former**, and you'll learn:

* how to **set up the estimation** of a covariance matrix;
* how to **plot the correlation coefficients**;
* how to **plot the uncertainty ellipsoids**.

For the **full estimation** of some selected parameters, such as initial state, drag coefficient, and radiation pressure coefficient of a spacecraft, see [DELFI-C3 - Parameter Estimation Example](full_estimation_example.ipynb).

To simulate the orbit of a spacecraft, we will fall back and reiterate on all aspects of orbit propagation that are important within the scope of orbit estimation. Further, we will highlight all relevant features of modelling a tracking station on Earth. Using this station, we will simulate a tracking routine of the spacecraft using a series of instantaneous unbiased one-way Doppler range-rate measurements with uncertainty of 1 mm/s every 60 seconds. To assure an uninterrupted line-of-sight between the station and the spacecraft, a minimum elevation angle of more than 15 degrees above the horizon - as seen from the station - will be imposed as constraint on the simulation of observations.

The first part of this example deals with the setup of all relevant (environment, propagation, and estimation) modules, so feel free to skip these steps if you're already familiar with them!

## Import statements
Typically - in the most pythonic way - all required modules are imported at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded: `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported. Most notably, the `estimation`, `estimation_setup`, and `observations` modules will be used and demonstrated within this example.

## Configuration
First, NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are loaded, to make the positions of various bodies such as the Earth, the Sun, or the Moon known to `tudatpy`.

Subsequently, the start and end epoch of the simulation and observations are defined.* Note that using `tudatpy`, the times are generally specified in seconds since J2000. Hence, setting the start epoch to `0` corresponds to the 1st of January 2000. The end epoch specifies a total duration of the simulation of four days.

For more information on J2000 and the conversion between different temporal reference frames, please refer to the [API documentation](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/time_conversion.html) of the `time_conversion` module.

*Please note that it is always a good practice to separate the observation start and end epochs from the simulated ones. This way, we ensure that the times at which the observations are simulated all fall within the simulation timespan, especially given the geometry of the problem and the time difference at the two link ends (receiver and transmitter are separated by a certain distance). For this reason, we will set the first observation start epoch at one day after the simulation start epoch, and the observation end epoch at one day before the end of the simulation.

To create the systems of bodies for the simulation, one first has to define a list of strings of all bodies that are to be included. Note that the default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from the `SPICE` kernel.

These settings, however, can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/environment_models.html#available-model-types) in the user guide for more details.

* Aerodynamic acceleration for Earth.

## Set up the observations
Having set the underlying dynamical model of the simulated orbit, we can define the **observational model**. Generally, this entails the addition of all required ground stations, the definition of the observation links and types, as well as the precise simulation settings.

Trivially, the simulation of observations requires the extension of the current environment by at least one observer - a ground station. For this example, we will model a single ground station located in Delft, Netherlands, at an altitude of 0m, 52.00667°N, 4.35556°E.

More information on how to use the `add_ground_station()` function can be found in the respective [API documentation](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/environment_setup.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.add_ground_station).

### Define Observation Links and Types
To establish the links between our ground station and `Delfi-C3`, we will make use of the [observation module](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/observation.html#observation) of tudat. During the link definition, each member is assigned a certain function within the link, for instance as "transmitter", "receiver", or "reflector". Once two (or more) members are connected to a link, they can be used to simulate observations along this particular link. The precise type of observation made along this link - e.g., range, range-rate, angular position, etc. - is then determined by the chosen observable type.

To fully define an observation model for a given link, we have to create a list of the observation model settings of all desired observable types and their associated links. This list will later be used as input to the actual estimator object. 

Each observable type has its own function for creating observation model settings - in this example we will use the `one_way_doppler_instantaneous()` function to model a series of one-way open-loop (i.e. instantaneous) Doppler observations. Realise that the individual observation model settings can also include corrective models or define biases for more advanced use-cases.

Note that the `one_way_doppler_instantaneous()` measurements use the **satellite** as **transmitter** and the **ground station** as **receiver**.

Bear in mind that these observation simulation settings are not to be confused with the ones to be used when setting up the estimator object, as done just above.

Finally, for each observation model, the observation simulation settings set the times at which observations are simulated and defines the viability criteria and noise of the observation. Realise that the latter is technically not needed within the scope of a covariance analysis but for the sake of completeness (and with eye for the estimation example re-using this code) we have opted to nonetheless include it already.

Note that the actual simulation of the observations requires `Observation Simulators`, which are created automatically by the `Estimator` object. Hence, one cannot simulate observations before the creation of an estimator.

It should be stressed that the general setup for either path to be followed is largely identical up to this point (see, for example, the [full estimation example](full_estimation_example.ipynb)).

### Set up the inversion
To set up the inversion of the problem, we collect all relevant inputs in the form of a covariance input object and define some basic settings of the inversion. Most crucially, this is the step where we can account for different weights - if any - of the different observations, to give the estimator knowledge about the quality of the individual types of observations.

### Computing the Covariance
Using the just defined inputs, we can ultimately run the computation of our covariance matrix. The formal errors are the square root of the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix. While the first six entries represent the uncertainties in the (cartesian) initial state, the seventh and eighth are the errors associated with the gravitational parameter of Earth and the aerodynamic drag coefficient, respectively.

When dealing with the results of covariance analyses - as a measure of how the estimated variable differs from the 'thought' true value - it is important to stress that the correlation between the parameters is another important aspect to take into consideration.

Perfect, we have got our results. Now it is time to make sense of them. To further process them, one can - exemplary - plot:

3) the history of the residuals;
4) the statistical interpretation of the final residuals.

This is defined by the **covariance matrix**, which also encodes information about the **correlations** between different parameters. Then, we will perform the same operation, taking the "*formal errors matrix*" instead (namely is the covariance where all the off-diagonal elements are set to zero) - and **we will compare the two ellipsoids** so obtained. 

#### Formal Errors and Covariance Matrix: How Are They Related?
Note how we have mentioned above that the **formal errors** constitute the **diagonal entries of the covariance matrix (variances)**. 
In practice, the "formal error matrix" is a covariance matrix where all the **off-diagonal terms are set to zero**. Recalling what done just above, this amounts discard any **correlation** in the errors between different parameters.
