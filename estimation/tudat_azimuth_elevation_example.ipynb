    "Whether you're looking to impress your friends by showing them when and where the **International Space Station** 🛰️ will pass overhead, or you need to verify if an **interplanetary probe** will be above a certain **elevation** for radio antenna communication 📡, this example has you covered. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to use **Tudatpy** to generate **visibility plots (azimuth and elevation)** for a specific target, from a selected location on Earth, across a given time period. In order to validate our results, we will compare them with results from the [JPL Horizons tool](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/). "

    "## Import Relevant Modules\n",
    "Let's start by importing all relevant modules and libraries. Notably, we will need the [HorizonsQuery class](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/horizons.html#tudatpy.data.horizons.HorizonsQuery), containing wrapper function to the [JPL Horizons tool](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/). We will also make use of Tudat's interface to the NASA's [spice tool](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/spice.html). The Horizons tool provides access to high-precision ephemerides for solar system objects, offering position and velocity data. The SPICE tool, developed by NASA, enables the computation of spacecraft trajectory, orientation, and other mission-related data using detailed planetary and satellite models."
