# Simulation and Estimation Using Different Dynamical Models
## Objectives
Within this example, we will go beyond the earlier introduced basic steps of setting up an orbit estimation routine. In particular, using several orbits of the **Mars Express (MEX)** spacecraft around the Red Planet, we will introduce different **new types of observables**, **observation constraints**, and finally focus on how to apply **different dynamical models** to the simulation of observations and the estimation, respectively. Since no further explanation with respect to already introduced functionalities will be given in this example, the reader is advised - if not already done so - to first browse to the [Parameter estimation example](full_estimation_example.ipynb).

Using **different dynamical models** for the simulation of observations and the subsequent estimation comes in handy when trying to **emulate what effects an imperfect dynamical model will have on the estimation** of selected parameters based on real-world data. 

**Here is why**: while real-world data stems from a perfectly 'modelled' environment, **the estimator will always be subject to modelling shortcomings**. So we will never be able to perfectly model reality when setting up our estimation model. 

When we are dealing with *simulated observed data* (which is still different from the *real world data*, it being simulated!), we need to mimic this above-mentioned discrepancy. So how do we do that? We use a **slightly less advanced model for the estimation than for the simulation of observations**. This way, we are able to artificially mock the discrepancy between the real world and the estimation model available, and gain insights into the behaviour and sensitivity of the found solution to **modelling imperfections**.

Some standard modules are first loaded: `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`. Moreover, we import `os` to be able to tell our system where it can find the downloaded SPICE kernel for Mars Express.

In particular, we will model **two-way range** and **range-rate (Doppler) observables**.

Moreover, expanding upon the knowledge from the [Parameter estimation example](full_estimation_example.ipynb), we will introduce how to introduce the settings for the light time correction of the signal due to the **relativistic effects of the Sun**, as well as how to impose a **constant bias** on one of the two observables.

## Define the Dynamical Model(s)
Note that unlike it has usually been the case so far - be it with examples dealing with propagation or the prior estimation ones - we have always defined a mere single dynamical model. The modular structure of tudat, however, enables us to simulate the observations using a dynamical model that is (theoretically entirely) different from the one used to perform the estimation. Hence, we will now first define the model that will be used during the simulation of observations. In particular, we will consider:

* Gravitational acceleration using a spherical harmonic approximation up to 4th degree and order for Mars.
* Gravitational acceleration using a simple point mass model for:

    - Mars' two moons Phobos and Deimos
    - Earth
    - Jupiter
    - The Sun

* Radiation pressure experienced by the spacecraft - shape-wise approximated as a spherical cannonball - due to the Sun.

### Perform the observations simulation
Following the known - trivial - estimation pipeline, the observations are simulated using the `simulation_observations()` function of the respective `Estimator` object. However, to avoid having to create two distinct estimators, we will manually implement a set of observation simulators upfront, before altering the dynamical model and creating the actual estimator.

The way custom-implemented observation simulators are implemented is that they do not propagate any bodies themselves but simulate the observations based on the (tabulated) ephemerides of all involved bodies. However, for this example, we wish to use "mock" ephemeris - coming from the propagation of an initial state using the propagation model we chose for simulating our observations, in place of the real (SPICE) ones. This means that we have to update the ephemeris of MEX such that it stems from the dynamical model of choice and not its `SPICE` kernel. In simple terms, these are the steps to follow:

1) Select the **initial MEX state**. This (*and only this!*) is taken from the **SPICE ephemeris.
2) Using the **chosen model and propagator, **propagate the initial MEX state**.
3) Save the **propagated states**. **These will be used as ephemeris** for our example.

Having updated the tabulated ephemeris of Mars Express, one can create the required `observation simulator` object and finally simulate the observations according to the above-defined settings.

### Estimate the individual parameters
Finally, the actual estimation can be performed - ideally having reached a sufficient level of convergence, the least squares estimator will have found the most suitable parameters for the problem at hand.

We will again qualitatively compare the goodness-of-fit of the found parameters with the known ground truth ones (**realise that this cannot typically be done when working with real-world observations, since the ground truth is not known, and is exactly what one would like to know!**). However, since we conveniently know these parameters, it serves as a handy measure to shed light onto the estimation process. In particular, this highlights the fact that with increasing discrepancy between the dynamical models used within the simulation and estimation routines, the true-to-formal error ratio has to increase, since - besides to the pure estimation of parameters - the (artificially) introduced modelling imperfections have to be implicitly mitigated altering the values of the same set of parameters.
