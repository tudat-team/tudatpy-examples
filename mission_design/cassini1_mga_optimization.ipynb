    "## Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the usage of PyGMO to optimize an interplanetary transfer trajectory simulated using the multiple gravity assist (MGA) module of Tudat. The trajectory optimization of the Cassini 1 problem, which corresponds to a simplified version of the real Cassini mission, is here solved. The Cassini 1 problem departs from the edge of Earth's SOI, executes gravity assists at Venus, Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, and finally is inserted into an orbit around Saturn with eccentricity $e = 0.98$ and semi-major axis $a = 1.0895e8 / 0.02$ km. Each transfer leg (i.e. between each two planets) is considered to be unpowered, with $\\Delta V$ s applied only during the gravity assists. Hence, the transfer is modeled as an [MGA with unpowered unperturbed legs](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/transfer_trajectory.html#tudatpy.trajectory_design.transfer_trajectory.mga_settings_unpowered_unperturbed_legs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The 6 design variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Departure time\n",
    "* Time of flight between consecutive planets (5 variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "The only objective function is the $\\Delta V$, which is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cassini 1 problem (among others) has been proposed and solved by ESA Advanced Concepts Team [(Vinkó et al, 2007)](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/MAD/pub/ACT-RPR-MAD-2007-BenchmarkingDifferentGlobalOptimisationTechniques.pdf). In this and other papers, various global optimisation problems related to spacecraft trajectory design are described and solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGMO is used in this example. It is assumed that the reader of this tutorial is already familiar with the content of [this basic PyGMO tutorial](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_advanced_topics/optimization_pygmo.html#about-pygmo)."
