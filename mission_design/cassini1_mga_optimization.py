## Context 
"""

This example illustrates the usage of PyGMO to optimize an interplanetary transfer trajectory simulated using the multiple gravity assist (MGA) module of Tudat. The trajectory optimization of the Cassini 1 problem, which corresponds to a simplified version of the real Cassini mission, is here solved. The Cassini 1 problem departs from the edge of Earth's SOI, executes gravity assists at Venus, Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, and finally is inserted into an orbit around Saturn with eccentricity $e = 0.98$ and semi-major axis $a = 1.0895e8 / 0.02$ km. Each transfer leg (i.e. between each two planets) is considered to be unpowered, with $\Delta V$ s applied only during the gravity assists. Hence, the transfer is modeled as an [MGA with unpowered unperturbed legs](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/transfer_trajectory.html#tudatpy.trajectory_design.transfer_trajectory.mga_settings_unpowered_unperturbed_legs).

The 6 design variables are:

* Departure time
* Time of flight between consecutive planets (5 variables)

The only objective function is the $\Delta V$, which is minimized.

The Cassini 1 problem (among others) has been proposed and solved by ESA Advanced Concepts Team [(VinkÃ³ et al, 2007)](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/MAD/pub/ACT-RPR-MAD-2007-BenchmarkingDifferentGlobalOptimisationTechniques.pdf). In this and other papers, various global optimisation problems related to spacecraft trajectory design are described and solved.

PyGMO is used in this example. It is assumed that the reader of this tutorial is already familiar with the content of [this basic PyGMO tutorial](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_advanced_topics/optimization_pygmo.html#about-pygmo).

## Import statements
"""

The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning. Some standard modules are first loaded (numpy, matplotlib and typing). Then, the different modules of tudatpy that will be used are imported. Finally, in this example, we also need to import the pygmo library.
"""

# General imports
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from typing import List, Tuple

# Tudat imports

from tudatpy.trajectory_design import transfer_trajectory

## Helpers
"""
First of all, let us define a helper function which is used throughout this example.
"""

# The design variables in the current optimization problem are the departure time and the time of flight between transfer nodes. However, to evaluate an MGA trajectory in Tudat it is necessary to specify a different set of parameters: node times, node free parameters, leg free parameters. This function converts a vector of design variables to the parameters which are used as input to the MGA trajectory object.
# 
# The node times are easily computed based on the departure time and the time of flight between nodes. Since an MGA transfer with unpowered legs is used, no node and leg free parameters are required; thus, these are defined as empty lists.

    transfer_trajectory_object: tudatpy.trajectory_design.transfer_trajectory.TransferTrajectory,

    accumulated_time = departure_time
    for i in range(0, transfer_trajectory_object.number_of_nodes - 1):
        accumulated_time += times_of_flight_per_leg[i]
        node_times.append(accumulated_time)

    # Get leg free parameters and node free parameters: one empty list per leg

    # One empty array for each node
    for i in range(transfer_trajectory_object.number_of_nodes):
        node_free_parameters.append([])

    return node_times, leg_free_parameters, node_free_parameters


## Optimisation problem
"""
The core of the optimization process is realized by PyGMO, which requires the definition of a problem class.
This definition has to be done in a class that is compatible with what the PyGMO library expects from a User Defined Problem (UDP). See [this page](https://esa.github.io/pygmo2/tutorials/coding_udp_simple.html) from the PyGMO's documentation as a reference. In this example, this class is called `TransferTrajectoryProblem`.

There are four mandatory methods that must be implemented in the class:

* `__init__()`: This is the constructor for the PyGMO problem class. It is used to save all the variables required to setup the evaluation of the transfer trajectory.
* `get_number_of_parameters(self)`: Returns the number of optimized parameters. In this case, that is the same as the number of flyby bodies (i.e. 6).
* `get_bounds(self)`: Returns the bounds for each optimized parameter. These are provided as an input to `__init__()`. Their values are defined later in this example.
* `fitness(self, x)`: Returns the cost associated with a vector of design parameters. Here, the fitness is the $\Delta V$ required to execute the transfer.

When selecting the algorithm, here the coefficient F is selected to have the value 0.5, instead of the default 0.8. Additionally, a fixed seed is selected; since PyGMO uses a random number generator, this ensures that PyGMO's results are reproducible.

According to [VinkÃ³ et al (2007)](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/MAD/pub/ACT-RPR-MAD-2007-BenchmarkingDifferentGlobalOptimisationTechniques.pdf), the best known solution for the Cassini 1 problem has a final objective function value of 4.93 km/s.

The executed optimization process results in a final objective function value of 4933.17 m/s, with a slightly different decision vector from the one presented by VinkÃ³ et al. (2017). This marginal difference can be explained by an inperfect convergence of the used optimizer, which is expected, considering that DE is a global optimizer. 

The evolution of the minimum $\Delta V$ throughout the optimization process can be plotted.
