# Setup a Panelled Radiation Pressure Model
## Objectives
This example demonstrates how to setup a panelled radiation pressure model (sometimes also called n-plate model) for a simple box-wing satellite.

The example introduces the basic steps that are required to define a plated radiation pressure target model. It showcases the different options that are available to define plate geometries available in the [vehicle_systems](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html) module and specify their radiative properties from the [radiation_pressure](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/radiation_pressure.html) module.
A cannonball target model is created along-side the plated model to highlight the differences between the two model setups.

## Pre-Requisites
This examples assumes that you are familiar with the necessary steps how to setup a simple orbit propagation in Tudat.
If you would like to revisit these steps, take a look at the [Keplerian orbit propagation example](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_getting_started/_src_examples/tudatpy-examples/propagation/keplerian_satellite_orbit.html) and in particular the [perturbed orbit propagation example](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_getting_started/_src_examples/tudatpy-examples/propagation/perturbed_satellite_orbit.html).

## Environment setup
Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. In this example an Earth-orbiting spacecraft will be modelled, following the previous examples.
Since we will also consider the radiation pressure acceleration by the Sun, we will create both the Sun and the Earth using the default settings.

Note that the default radiation source model assigned to the Sun is based on a constant luminosity, as listed in the [default environment models](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/default_env_models.html#radiation-source). Other options for solar radiation pressure as well as planetary radiation pressure exist, see the [radiation source models](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/propagation_setup/translational/radiation_pressure_acceleration.html#radiation-source-models) section in the user guide.

"""
## Create the panelled target model settings

The panelled target model is now created, following the same geometry as described previously.
The definition of the panelled settings can be divided in six steps:

1. Create **geometry settings** for all n panels using `*_panel_geometry()` functions of [vehicle_systems](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html) module
2. Create **reflection law settings** for all panels using `*_body_panel_reflection()` functions of [radiation_pressure](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/radiation_pressure.html) module
3. **Merge geometry settings and reflection law settings** using [body_panel_settings()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.body_panel_settings) function to create [BodyPanelSettings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.BodyPanelSettings) for all n panels.
4. **Merge all [BodyPanelSettings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.BodyPanelSettings)** to create [FullPanelledBodySettings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.FullPanelledBodySettings) using [full_panelled_body_settings()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.full_panelled_body_settings) function.
5. Add [FullPanelledBodySettings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.FullPanelledBodySettings) to [vehicle_shape_settings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/environment_setup.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.BodySettings.vehicle_shape_settings) attribute of spacecraft body settings
6. Create **panelled radiation pressure target settings** and define occulting bodies using [panelled_radiation_target()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/radiation_pressure.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.radiation_pressure.panelled_radiation_target) function. Note: Since the panel settings are part of the [vehicle_shape_settings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/environment_setup.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.BodySettings.vehicle_shape_settings) attribute of the body settings, this function does not take the panel settings as user-input.

Note: If you would like to define a standard box-wing spacecraft model, take a look at the [box_wing_panelled_body_settings()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.box_wing_panelled_body_settings) function, which takes care of steps 1-4.

In addition to the steps outlined above, the spacecraft needs to have a rotation model defined. See the [rotation_model](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/rotation_model.html) module for different options.
"""

"""
### Define rotation model

Before defining all the panel geometries, the rotation model of the spacecraft is defined, which determines the orientation of the body-fixed spacecraft frame with respect to the inertial space.

It is assumed that the body-fixed x-axis of the spacecraft is colinear to the velocity vector. Since the spacecraft is in a nearly circular orbit, this corresponds to an approximately nadir-pointing attitude.
The selected rotation model is therefore defined based on the orbital state using the [orbital_state_direction_based()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/rotation_model.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.rotation_model.orbital_state_direction_based) model.

        target_frame="DelfiBF",
    )
)
body_settings.get("Delfi-NP").rotation_model_settings = rotation_model_settings


"""
### 1. Create geometry settings

In the first step, the geometry settings of all panels are created.
This includes the outward normal vector of the panel surface (either fixed in a frame or time-varying) and the corresponding area of the panel.

Three options are available to define panel geometries:

- [frame_fixed_panel_geometry()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.frame_fixed_panel_geometry)
- [time_varying_panel_geometry()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.time_varying_panel_geometry)
- [body_tracking_panel_geometry()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.body_tracking_panel_geometry)

For our 3U cubesat with an additional solar panel, 7 panels need to be defined.
As all cubesat sidewalls have constant orientation in the body-frame, the `frame_fixed_panel_geometry` will be used for these.
The solar panel will be defined such that it always tracks the Sun.
Conveniently, this can be defined using the `body_tracking_panel_geometry` function.

Note: For higher fidelity applications, the solar panel may be defined based on a spacecraft frame kernel using SPICE.
In this case, the `frame_fixed_panel_geometry` can be used with the `frame_orientation` argument defined accordingly.

### 2. - 3. Create reflection law settings and merge geometry and reflection law settings
To define the panel settings, the reflection law needs to be defined for all panels.
In this simplified model, a Lambertian reflection law is assumed for the spacecraft body (no specular reflections), while the solar panels reflect incoming radiation in both specular and diffuse components.

Having defined the reflection laws, the geometry settings of all n plates are then combined with the corresponding reflection law using the [body_panel_settings()](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/vehicle_systems.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.vehicle_systems.body_panel_settings) function and stored in a combined list.

These settings can then be assigned to the spacecraft body settings.

Finally, the radiation target model settings are defined.
Note that these settings do not define the panel model itself (which is defined in the [vehicle_shape_settings](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/environment_setup.html#tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.BodySettings.vehicle_shape_settings)), but rather that the spacecraft should use a paneled target model, which is (internally) taken from the vehicle shape settings.
