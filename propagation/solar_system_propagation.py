## Context
"""
This example demonstrates a multi-body propagation of simplified inner solar system model.
Multi-body propagations become necessary when one or more propagated bodies cannot be treated as quasi-massless.
Through their non-negligible mass, the bodies mutually exert accelerations on each other and thereby affecting each others' future states.

In order to consistently simulate the evolution of such a system, the equations of motion of all massive bodies have to be propagated concurrently in a multi-body propagation.

The example showcases the versatility with which the propagation_setup module allows for advanced multi-body acceleration models and propagators.
Via the selected_acceleration_per_body argument of the `propagation_setup.create_acceleration_models()` function, acceleration model settings can be defined for an arbitrary amount of bodies in the system.

The central_bodies argument gives the option specify the centre of propagation for each propagated body individually.
In this script, this feature is used to implement a hierarchical propagation scheme.

## Import statements
"""
The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded. These are `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.
"""

import numpy as np

from tudatpy.util import result2array
from tudatpy.astro.time_conversion import DateTime


## Configuration
"""
NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are first loaded, so that the position of various bodies such as the Earth can be make known to `tudatpy`.

Then, the start and end simulation epochs are setups. In this case, the start epoch is set to `1e7`, corresponding to 10 million seconds ($\approx$ 115.74 days) after the 1st of January 2000. The end epoch is set 5 years later.

The times should always be specified in seconds since J2000.
Please refer to the API documentation of the `time_conversion module` [here](https://tudatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/time_conversion.html) for more information on this.

## Environment setup
"""
Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.

"""

### Create the bodies
"""
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

Finally, the system of bodies is created using the settings. This system of bodies is stored into the variable `body_system`.

## Propagate the bodies
"""
Each of the bodies can now be simulated.

This is done by calling the `create_dynamics_simulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation` module.
This function requires the `body_system` and the appropriate `propagator_settings_X` (with X being the propagation varian), that have all been defined earlier.

In the same step, the history of the propagated states over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history takes the form of a dictionary. The keys are the simulated epochs, and the values are an array containing the states of all of the bodies one after another.
