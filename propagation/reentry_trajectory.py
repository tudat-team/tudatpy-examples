# Re-entry trajectory using custom aerodynamic guidance

## Objectives

This examples focuses on the application of aerodynamic guidance in the context of a re-entry trajectory of the Space Transportation System (STS).

The aerodynamic guidance updates the angle of attack and the bank angle of the vehicle based on its flight conditions.
The angle of attack is set to 40deg for a Mach number above 12, to 10deg for a Mach number below 6, and varies linearly between them. The bank angle is computed such that the derivative of the flight path angle over time equals 0, and the flight path angle is then constant.
To do so, this example also showcases how to extract and use the flight condition
and body properties during the simulation.

The initial state of the STS is most notably its initial altitude of 120km, velocity of 7.5km/s, and its flight path angle of -0.6deg.

A high number of dependent variable are also propagated in this example. All of them are then plotted at the end of this script.

## Aerodynamic guidance class

First of all, let's  create a class that contains the aerodynamic guidance. This class needs to be inherited from `propagation.AerodynamicGuidance`.

During the initialisation of this class, the current system of simulated bodies will have to be input.

Then, the class must contain an `updateGuidance()` function that will be called at each simulation time step, taking the time as an input.
Most importantly, this function updates both the angle of attack (`self.angle_of_attack`) and bank angle (`self.bank_angle`) of the vehicle.

The angle of attack $\alpha$ should be updated as a function of the Mach number $M$ as follows:

- $\alpha = 40$ deg if $M > 12$.
- $\alpha = 10$ deg if $M < 6$.
- $\alpha$ varies linearly between the two boundaries for other $M$.

In practice, the following Logistic function is used so that the transition in $\alpha$ between $M=12$ and $M=6$ is smoother:
$$
\alpha = \frac{30}{1 + e^{-2 (M-9) }} + 10
$$

The bank angle $\sigma$ is computed so that, ideally, the flight path angle $\gamma$ should stay constant over time ($\dot{\gamma} = 0$).
The change in flight path angle over time $\dot{\gamma}$ is related to the bank angle $\sigma$ trough the equation below. We thus compute $\sigma$ so that this equation equals 0.
$$
V \dot{\gamma} = \frac{L}{m} \cos \sigma - \left( g_d - \frac{V^2}{r} \right) \cos \gamma + 2 \omega_E V \cos \delta \sin \chi + \omega^2_E r \cos \delta (\cos \delta \cos \gamma + \sin \gamma \sin \delta \cos \chi)
$$
In this equation, $\chi$ and $\delta$ are the heading and latitude angles. $L$, $m$, $V$, and $\omega_E$ are the lift force, vehicle mass, airspeed, and Earth rotation rate. $g_d$ is the downwards (towards the centre of Earth) component of the gravitational acceleration. All of these values are either directly obtained or computed from the flight conditions, the aerodynamic coefficient interface, or the aerodynamic coefficient interface.
