# Keplerian satellite orbit

## Objectives
This example demonstrates the **basic propagation** of a (quasi-massless) body under the influence of a **central point-mass attractor**. It therefore resembles the classic **two-body problem**.

Due to the quasi-massless nature of the propagated body, **no accelerations have to be modelled on the central body**, which is therefore **not propagated**.
As one would expect from this setup, the trajectory of the propagated quasi-massless body describes a **Keplerian orbit**.

Amongst others, the example showcases the creation of bodies using properties from standard SPICE data `get_default_body_settings()`, as well as the element conversion functionalities `keplerian_to_cartesian_elementwise()` of tudat.
It also demonstrates how the results of the propagation can be **accessed and processed**.

## Import statements
The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded: `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.

## Configuration
NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are first loaded, so that the position of various bodies such as the Earth can be make known to `tudatpy`.

Then, the start and end simulation epochs are setups. In this case, the start epoch is set to `0`, corresponding to the 1st of January 2000.
The end epoch is defined as 1 day later.
The times should be specified in seconds since J2000.
Please refer to the [API documentation](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/time_conversion.html) of the `time_conversion` module for more information on this.

## Environment setup
Let’s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.

### Create the bodies
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/environment_models.html#available-model-types) in the user guide for more details.

## Propagate the orbit
The orbit is now ready to be propagated.

This is done by calling the `create_dynamics_simulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation` module.
This function requires the `bodies` and `propagator_settings` that have all been defined earlier.

After this, the history of the propagated state over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history, taking the form of a dictionary, is then converted to an array containing 7 columns:

- Column 0: Time history, in seconds since J2000.
