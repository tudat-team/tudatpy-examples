## Context
"""
This example demonstrates the simulation of the ascent trajectory of a two stage rocket on Mars. Two simulations are carried: one for each stage. In these simulations, both the dynamic state and the mass of the vehicle are propagated.

To ascent to orbit, the rocket needs thrust. This example thus also focuses on demonstrating various aspect of thrust that are available in Tudat(Py). More specifically, dual thrust is implemented, simulating a solid propellant which burns with a magnitude 1.75 times higher in the 15 first seconds.

Aerodynamic guidance is also included, as to very simply update the angle of attack of the vehicle over time, simulating an oscillation between -2deg and 2deg.

A custom termination setting is also showcased, used to switch from the first stage to the second stage when apogee is reached.
"""

## Import statements
"""
The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded. These are `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `datetime.datetime`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.
"""

## Configuration
"""
NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are first loaded, so that the position of various bodies such as the Earth can be make known to `tudatpy`.

Then, the start and end simulation epochs are setups. In this case, the start epoch is set to the 17th of February 2031. This epoch is first defined using the `datetime` module. Because the times should be specified in seconds since J2000, the `time_conversion module` is then used to convert the `datetime` to the correct format.

## Environment setup
"""
Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.

"""

### Create the bodies
"""
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

For our central body Mars, a predefined exponential atmosphere is then loaded.

Finally, the system of bodies is created using the settings. This system of bodies is stored into the variable `bodies`.

## First section simulation
"""
In this example, our rocket consists of two stages. Do note that, further, the nomenclature of rocket **sections** is used, rather than rocket **stages**. The first rocket section contains both the first and the second stage. The second rocket section contains only the second stage. Section 1 is thus before stage separation, and section 2 after.

Two distinct propagations will be made, one for each rocket section. The first section is numerically propagated until stage separation at apogee. Then, the second rocket section is propagated with a different body, with different properties, starting from where the first section stopped.

In a first time, we will thus focus on the ascent of the first section. Many functions will be defined in this example to setup the propagation of the first section. This is because the second section uses a similar setup, and will later re-use these functions.
"""

### Create the vehicle
"""
Let's now create our vehicle for the first section, called "Section 1". It has an initial mass of 370kg.

# - A reference area of 0.25m$^2$.
# - No moment coefficient.

### Propagation setup
"""
Now that the environment is created, the propagation setup is defined.

First, the bodies to be propagated and the central bodies will be defined.
Central bodies are the bodies with respect to which the state of the respective propagated bodies is defined.

The body to be propagated in the first part of this example is the first rocket section.
"""

# Define bodies that are propagated
bodies_to_propagate = ["Section 1"]

# Define central bodies of propagation
central_bodies = ["Mars"]


#### Thrust model
"""
Let's now define a thrust class, which will contain all of the functions needed to fully define a custom thrust model.

As always in an ascent problem, we cannot use thrust anymore when the current stage has exhausted its propellant. The first function, `is_thrust_on()`, returns True when thrust can be used, and False when all of the propellant has been used.

Then, the `get_thrust_magnitude()` function returns the current thrust magnitude. This magnitude is 1.75 times higher in the first 15 seconds, simulating the dual thrust of a solid propellant motor. This results in the following function for the thrust over time, with the time since engine start $t$ in seconds, and the user-set thrust magnitude $F_{T_\text{set}}$ in Newtons:
$$
F_T(t) = 
\begin{cases}
1.75 \cdot F_{T_\text{set}} & \text{if }t < 15 \\
F_{T_\text{set}} & \text{if }t \geq 15
\end{cases}
$$

The constant specific impulse is returned by the `get_specific_impulse()` function.

Finally, the `get_thrust_direction()` returns the angle of the thrust in the **inertial frame**, as defined by the `vertical_angle` variable that specifies the angle of the thrust w.r.t. the axis going from the vehicle to the centre of Mars (the **vertical frame**). This unit vector that represents the thrust angle in the inertial frame $\hat{\mathbf{f}}_T$ is computed as below, with the rotation matrix from the vertical frame to the inertial frame $\mathbf{R}^{I/V}$ and the specified thrust angle in the vertical frame $\alpha_V$.

$$
\hat{\mathbf{f}}_T = \mathbf{R}^{I/V} \cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\sin \alpha_V \\
-\cos \alpha_V
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can now run the ascent simulation for the second section.

Note that this may take a little longer to run, since it will propagate for up to half a day, instead of around 10 minutes until apogee.

With the ascent simulation of both sections completed, we can now analyse the results. Most importantly, this consists in plotting the various dependent variables that has been saved over time.

### Results analysis
"""
Finally, we can analyse the plot that we produce, giving various insights in our numerical simulation of a two-stage rocket ascent on Mars.

"""

#### Altitude over time
"""
In the first plot on the top left, we can see the altitude plotted as a function of time. This shows that the rocket progressively gains more and more altitude, as its accelerates. After stage separation, at around 9min, when the second stage ignites, the rocket does not gain significantly more altitude. This is because the second stage fires only horizontally. Because it does so at apoapsis, it fires only prograde, increasing the prograde (horizontal) velocity of the rocket, without increasing its radial (vertical) velocity. Afterwards, we see oscillations between around 150km and 900km. This shows that our vehicle is now in orbit.

"""

#### Airspeed over time
"""
The second plot on the top right clearly shows that the rocket gains considerable speed in the first seconds, when the first stage fires. At first stage burnout, the velocity starts decreasing. This is because we loose velocity for altitude, until we reach apoapsis. At apoapsis, the second stage ignites, and the velocity increases considerably again. Afterwards, we see oscillations between around 3.4 and 2.7 km/s, showing that our vehicle is at orbital velocity around Mars.

"""

#### Rocket mass over time
"""
The thrust plot in the middle left shows the mass of our rocket over time in its first 10 minutes. We can clearly identify the two moments where the rocket burns propellant, indicated by the two sections where the mass linearly decreases, from 0min to 2min, and from 9min to 10min. During the burns, since the rocket has a thrust magnitude that is 1.75 times higher in the first 15 seconds, it also looses propellant 1.75 times faster. This can be seen by the higher mass rate at the beginning of the ignition of both stages.
Finally, we can see at around 9min that the two stages separate, because our rocket mass instantaneously changes from 185kg to 85kg.

"""

#### Dynamic pressure over time
"""
The fourth plot, in the middle right, shows the dynamic pressure over time in front of our rocket. While the model used to compute it is rather simplistic, it still gives a good indication as when max-q (moment of maximum dynamic pressure) is reached, and of its magnitude. This maximum dynamic pressure may be lower than expected, since we are flying on Mars and not the Earth.

"""

#### Accelerations over time
"""
Finally, the plot at the bottom shows various accelerations over time. Clearly, thrust gives the acceleration of the highest magnitude. Once again, we can see that the thrust was each time of a magnitude 1.75 times higher in the first 15 seconds. Also, we can see that the thrust acceleration increases over time during each of the burn. This can be expected: the acceleration that results in the thrust force becomes higher over time as our rocket mass becomes lower.
The Martian gravitational acceleration comes second in magnitude. While it appears constant, because its magnitude is much lower than the one of the thrust, this gravitational acceleration decreases as altitude increases.
Finally, the aerodynamic acceleration is only significant in the first 2min of the ascent. One may realise that this acceleration follows a similar shape as the dynamic pressure over time. This is because the aerodynamic acceleration relies purely on the aerodynamic coefficients (which are constant in this case), the angle of attack (that varies only between -2deg and 2deg), and the dynamic pressure.
