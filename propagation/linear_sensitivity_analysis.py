## Context
"""
This example is an extension of the Perturbed Satellite Orbit Application. It adopts the simulation setup from the Perturbed Satellite Orbit, considering a slightly reduced set of perturbing accelerations for the propagation of the vehicle.

The script demonstrates how the basic numerical simulation setup (aiming to propagate the state of the system) can swiftly be extended to enable a study of the system's sensitivity.

Via the `estimation_setup.parameter module`, the system parameters w.r.t. which the sensitivity is to be studied are defined and a `create_variational_equations_solver` function from the numerical_simulation module is used in order to setup and integrate the system's variational equations. After obtaining the state transition matrices from the integrated variational equations, the system's response to small perturbations can be tested via simple matrix multiplication.


The availability of variational equations in tudat enables many more, advanced functionalities, such as covariance analysis and precise orbit determination.

## Import statements

The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded. These are `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

    - Mars
    - Venus

* Gravitational acceleration using a Spherical Harmonic approximation up to degree and order 5 from Earth.
* Aerodynamic acceleration from Earth.

This initial state always has to be provided as a cartesian state, in the form of a list with the first three elements representing the initial position, and the three remaining elements representing the initial velocity.

Within this example, we will retrieve the initial state of Delfi-C3 using its Two-Line-Elements (TLE) the date of its launch (April the 28th, 2008). The TLE strings are obtained from [space-track.org](https://www.space-track.org).

## Propagate the dynamics

In this example, since we wish to propagate the variational equations in addition to the satellite state, we use the `create_variational_equations_solver()` function (instead of the `create_dynamics_simulator()` function that we would normally use).

This function takes additional arguments: the parameters that have to be estimated, and a boolean to specify that the parameters will be integrated immediately when the function is called.
