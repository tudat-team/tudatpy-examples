## Context
"""

This example demonstrates how Multiple Gravity Assist (MGA) transfer trajectories can be simulated. Three types of transfers are analyzed:

* High-thrust transfer with unpowered legs
* High-thrust transfer with deep space maneuvers (DSMs) and manually-created legs and nodes
* Low-thrust transfer with hodographic shaping

 
In addition, this example show how the results, such as partial $\Delta V$, total $\Delta V$ and time of flight
values can be retrieved from the transfer object.

A complete guide on transfer trajectory design is given on [this page](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/astrodynamics/trajectory_design.html) of tudat user documentation.

## Import statements
"""

The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded: numpy and matplotlib.pyplot.

Then, the different modules of tudatpy that will be used are imported.

# First, let's explore an MGA transfer trajectory with no thrust applied during the transfer legs. In this case, the impulsive $\Delta V$ maneuvers are only applied during the gravity assists.

### Setup and inputs
"""

A simplified system of bodies suffices for this application, with the Sun as central body. The planets that are visited for a gravity assist are defined in the list `transfer_body_order`. The first body in the list is the departure body and the last one is the arrival body.

The departure and arrival orbit can be specified, but they are not mandatory. If not specified, the departure and arrival planets are selected to be swing-by nodes.
Departures and arrivals at the edge of the Sphere Of Influence (SOI) of a node can be done by specifying eccentricity $e=0$ and semi-major axis $a=\infty$.

In this example, the spacecraft departs from the edge of Earthâ€™s SOI and is inserted into a highly elliptical orbit around Saturn.

## MGA transfer with DSMs and manually-created settings
"""
This next part of the example now makes use of DSMs in between the nodes. The general approach is similar to the example without DSMs, with some modifications to the inputs and transfer parameters. Additionally, the manual creation of the nodes and legs settings is here exemplified, instead of using a factory function to get them.
"""

### Setup and inputs
"""
Again, a simplified system of bodies suffices. In this case, a transfer to Mercury is considered with gravity assists at Earth and Venus. As before, the departure and arrival orbits, and the central body (Sun) are also specified: the transfer is considered to start at the edge of Earth's SOI and end at the edge of Mercury's SOI.

departure_semi_major_axis = np.inf
departure_eccentricity = 0.0

arrival_semi_major_axis = np.inf
arrival_eccentricity = 0.0


### Create transfer settings and transfer object
"""

Since, in this example, the DSMs are specified using the velocity formulation, one can use the `mga_settings_dsm_velocity_based_legs` factory function to create the nodes and legs settings (option 1 in the code block below). This is the same approach followed in the example without DSMs.

Alternatively, one can create the nodes and legs settings manually (option 2 in the code block below): 

- The legs settings are a list containing the settings of each leg in the transfer. Here, only velocity-based DSM legs are used, therefore the settings of each leg are created by calling the `dsm_velocity_based_leg` factory function (this is repeated for all legs in the transfer). 
- The nodes settings are a list containing the settings of each leg in the transfer. The nodes used in this transfer are a departure node (beginning of the transfer), several swingby nodes, and an arrival node (end of the transfer). Thus, the node settings are created by calling `departure_node` once, calling `swingby_node` four times, and calling `capture_node` once.

Although the manual creation of the nodes and legs settings is a bit more complex than directly calling the `mga_settings_dsm_velocity_based_legs` factory function, it also allows more flexibility in the design of the transfer. For example, with manually-created legs settings, it is possible to create a transfer which mixes high- and low-thrust arcs (this is known as a hybrid-thrust transfer, their study is still a very new research area... perhaps you can contribute to it!).

### Create transfer settings and transfer object
"""

The creation of the transfer settings for a hodographic shaping leg requires, in particular, selecting the shaping functions. Each hodographic shaping leg is defined by a series of shaping functions, which determine the evolution of the velocity profile (in cylindrical coordinates) as a function of time throughout the transfer. Hence, it is necessary to select the terms constituting the shaping functions for the radial, normal, and axial velocity. Each shaping function has the form $\sum_i c_i \cdot f_i(t), \ i \geq 3$, with $c_i$ a constant and $f_i(t)$ a function of time (e.g. sine, cosine, exponential, power, etc.). In order to meet the boundary constraints, each shaping function requires a minimum of three terms; the coefficients of these terms (i.e. $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$) are determined automatically. Additional shaping terms may be specified, which will further influence the evolution of the transfer; the coefficients of these terms (i.e. $c_i, \ i > 3$) are leg free parameters, and have to be specified by the user. 

If shaping functions with only three terms are specified, then each hodographic-shaping leg has only one parameter that needs to be specified by the user. The legs and nodes settings for such a transfer can be created using the `mga_settings_hodographic_shaping_legs_with_recommended_functions` factory function, which selects a set of recommended shaping functions.  

To select shaping function with terms other than the recommended ones or with more terms, the nodes and legs settings can be retrieved using the `mga_settings_hodographic_shaping_legs` factory function. This approach is followed here.

The first step is to select the number of revolutions and time of flight of each leg. Contrary to the previous examples, this parameters are specified before the creation of the transfer trajectory object because they are used when selecting the shaping functions. Next, one can select the shaping functions. The shaping functions used here were selected according to ([Gondelach, 2012](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:6a4f1673-88b1-4823-b2ef-9d864c84ab11), section 11.2), who finds these functions to offer the best performance for an Earth-Mars transfer.

### Define transfer parameters

# In this case, there is a much larger list of free parameters than in the previous cases. As before, the first parameters are the node times, corresponding to the times when the spacecraft encounters each planet. Next, the node free parameters are required. These include the selection of the departure velocity at the departure node (3 parameters), the arrival velocity at each swingby node (3 parameters per node), the characteristics of each swingby (3 parameters per node), and the arrival velocity at the arrival node (3 parameters). Finally, it is necessary to specify the leg free parameters. These consist of the number of revolutions of each leg (1 parameter per leg), and of two free coefficients per velocity component per leg (6 parameters per leg).
# 
# The parameters used in this example were determined via optimization, using PyGMO. The code used to optimize the transfer is analyzed in [this example](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src_getting_started/_src_examples/notebooks/pygmo/hodographic_shaping_mga_optimization.ipynb).

Having selected the transfer parameters, it is now possible to evaluate the transfer.

### Extract results and plot trajectory
"""
Finally, the results are extracted and used to analyze the transfer trajectory.

#### Print results

Again, the values for the $\Delta V$ and time of flight can be retrieved.

#### Plot the transfer
"""
Similarly to the previous cases, the state history throughout the transfer can be retrieved with `states_along_trajectory`. Furthermore, it is possible to retrieve the thrust acceleration history with respect to different reference frames (inertial, TNW, and RSW). Below, the thrust acceleration is retrieved with respect to a TNW frame (through `tnw_thrust_accelerations_along_trajectory`) and plotted.
