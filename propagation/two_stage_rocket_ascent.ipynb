    "## Context\n",
    "This example demonstrates the simulation of the ascent trajectory of a two stage rocket on Mars. Two simulations are carried: one for each stage. In these simulations, both the dynamic state and the mass of the vehicle are propagated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ascent to orbit, the rocket needs thrust. This example thus also focuses on demonstrating various aspect of thrust that are available in Tudat(Py). More specifically, dual thrust is implemented, simulating a solid propellant which burns with a magnitude 1.75 times higher in the 15 first seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerodynamic guidance is also included, as to very simply update the angle of attack of the vehicle over time, simulating an oscillation between -2deg and 2deg.\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom termination setting is also showcased, used to switch from the first stage to the second stage when apogee is reached."

    "### Results analysis\n",
    "Finally, we can analyse the plot that we produce, giving various insights in our numerical simulation of a two-stage rocket ascent on Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Altitude over time\n",
    "In the first plot on the top left, we can see the altitude plotted as a function of time. This shows that the rocket progressively gains more and more altitude, as its accelerates. After stage separation, at around 9min, when the second stage ignites, the rocket does not gain significantly more altitude. This is because the second stage fires only horizontally. Because it does so at apoapsis, it fires only prograde, increasing the prograde (horizontal) velocity of the rocket, without increasing its radial (vertical) velocity. Afterwards, we see oscillations between around 150km and 900km. This shows that our vehicle is now in orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Airspeed over time\n",
    "The second plot on the top right clearly shows that the rocket gains considerable speed in the first seconds, when the first stage fires. At first stage burnout, the velocity starts decreasing. This is because we loose velocity for altitude, until we reach apoapsis. At apoapsis, the second stage ignites, and the velocity increases considerably again. Afterwards, we see oscillations between around 3.4 and 2.7 km/s, showing that our vehicle is at orbital velocity around Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rocket mass over time\n",
    "The thrust plot in the middle left shows the mass of our rocket over time in its first 10 minutes. We can clearly identify the two moments where the rocket burns propellant, indicated by the two sections where the mass linearly decreases, from 0min to 2min, and from 9min to 10min. During the burns, since the rocket has a thrust magnitude that is 1.75 times higher in the first 15 seconds, it also looses propellant 1.75 times faster. This can be seen by the higher mass rate at the beginning of the ignition of both stages.\n",
    "Finally, we can see at around 9min that the two stages separate, because our rocket mass instantaneously changes from 185kg to 85kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic pressure over time\n",
    "The fourth plot, in the middle right, shows the dynamic pressure over time in front of our rocket. While the model used to compute it is rather simplistic, it still gives a good indication as when max-q (moment of maximum dynamic pressure) is reached, and of its magnitude. This maximum dynamic pressure may be lower than expected, since we are flying on Mars and not the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accelerations over time\n",
    "Finally, the plot at the bottom shows various accelerations over time. Clearly, thrust gives the acceleration of the highest magnitude. Once again, we can see that the thrust was each time of a magnitude 1.75 times higher in the first 15 seconds. Also, we can see that the thrust acceleration increases over time during each of the burn. This can be expected: the acceleration that results in the thrust force becomes higher over time as our rocket mass becomes lower.\n",
    "The Martian gravitational acceleration comes second in magnitude. While it appears constant, because its magnitude is much lower than the one of the thrust, this gravitational acceleration decreases as altitude increases.\n",
    "Finally, the aerodynamic acceleration is only significant in the first 2min of the ascent. One may realise that this acceleration follows a similar shape as the dynamic pressure over time. This is because the aerodynamic acceleration relies purely on the aerodynamic coefficients (which are constant in this case), the angle of attack (that varies only between -2deg and 2deg), and the dynamic pressure."
