    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the setup and propagation of orbits and their invariant manifolds in the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP) with polyhedral secondary. Additionally, it demonstrates the propagation of trajectories up to a surface impact (with the polyhedron), using hybrid termination conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant manifolds of a planar Lyapunov orbit around the L2 point of the Mars-Phobos system are computed. The system is modeled using the CR3BP with Mars' gravity being described by a point mass and Phobos' gravity by a polyhedron (since Phobos is a small, irregular moon). Phobos is considered to be tidally locked. The invariant manifolds are propagated until a maximum time, maximum distance to Phobos, or impact with Phobos (whatever happens first). The trajectories are propagated using a dimensionless state (with the typical CR3BP units of length and time).\n",

    "The different trajectories are propagated with respect to a Mars-centered inertially-oriented frame, but analyzed with respect to a Phobos-centered rotating (synodic) frame."
