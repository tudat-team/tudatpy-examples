## Context
"""

This example demonstrates the basic use of thrust in the Earth-Moon system.

Thrust is implemented to be of constant magnitude and to be collinear with velocity (pushing the simulated vehicle from behind).
In addition to the acceleration from the thrust, a basic model is set up, consisting of the acceleration of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, only considering them as point masses.

The mass of the vehicle is propagated using a mass rate model consistent with the rocket thrust used.

How to set up dependent variables to save the mass and altitude of the vehicle over time is demonstrated.

Termination settings based on the minimum mass of the vehicle and its maximum altitude are shown.

Finally, how to plot the trajectory of the Vehicle and of the Moon in 3D is demonstrated.
For this purpose, this example also shows how to extract the position of the Moon over time from SPICE.

## Import statements
"""

The required import statements are made here at the beginning of the code.

Some standard modules are first loaded: `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

The different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are then imported.

## Configuration
"""

NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are first loaded so that the position of various bodies such as the Earth can be make known to `tudatpy`.

Then the start and end simulation epochs are set up. In this case, the start epoch is set to `1e7`, which corresponds to 10 million seconds ($\approx$ 115.74 days) after the 1st of January 2000.

The times should always be specified in seconds since the epoch of J2000.
Please refer to the API documentation of the `time_conversion module` [here](https://tudatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/time_conversion.html) for more information on this.

## Environment setup
"""

Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.
"""

### Create the bodies
"""

Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that are to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

Finally, the system of bodies is created using the settings. This system of bodies is stored in the variable `bodies`.

### Create the vehicle
"""

Let's now create the 5000 kg Vehicle for which the trajectory between the Earth and the Moon will be propagated.
"""

# # Create the vehicle body in the environment
body_settings.add_empty_settings("Vehicle")
body_settings.get("Vehicle").constant_mass = 5000


### Define the thrust guidance settings
"""

Let's now define the aspects of the body related to thrust: its orientation and its engine.

First, the `thrust_direction_settings` are set up so that the thrust is always acting aligned with the velocity vector of the vehicle, ensuring that the orbit is continuously raised.

Next the `thrust_magnitude_settings` are set up to indicate that a constant thrust of 10N is used.

## Propagation setup
"""

Now that the environment is created, the propagation setup is defined.

### Create the acceleration model
"""

First off, the acceleration settings that act on the Vehicle are to be defined.
In this case, these consist of the followings:

- Acceleration from the constant thrust, using the settings defined earlier.
- Gravitational acceleration from the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, all modeled as point masses.

The defined acceleration settings are then applied to the Vehicle in a dictionary.

Finally, this dictionary is input to the propagation setup to create the acceleration models.

### Define the initial state
"""

The initial state of the Vehicle that will be propagated is now defined.

In this example, this state is very straightforwardly set directly in cartesian coordinates.

The Vehicle will thus start 8,000 km from the center of the Earth, at a velocity of 7.5 km/s.

### Create the termination settings
"""

Let's now define a set of termination settings. In this setup, once any single one of them is fulfilled, the propagation stops.

These settings are the following:

- Stop when the altitude get above 100,000 km.
- Stop when the Vehicle has a mass of 4,000 kg (burned 1,000 kg of propellant).
- Stop when the Vehicle reaches the specified end epoch (after 30 days).

### Create the integrator settings
"""

The last step before starting the simulation is to set up the integrator that will be used.

### Create the propagator settings
"""

The propagator settings are now defined.

As usual, translational propagation settings are defined, using a Cowell propagator.

Finally, a multitype propagator is defined, encompassing both the translational and the mass propagators.

## Propagate the orbit
"""

The orbit from the Earth to the Moon is now ready to be propagated.

This is done by calling the `create_dynamics_simulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation module`.
This function requires the `system_of_bodies` and `propagator_settings` that have all been defined earlier.

After this, the history of the propagated state over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history, taking the form of a dictionary, is then converted to an array containing 7 columns:

- Column 0: Time history, in seconds since J2000.
- Columns 1 to 3: Position history, in meters, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.
- Columns 4 to 6: Velocity history, in meters per second, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.

The same is done with the dependent variable history. The column indexes corresponding to a given dependent variable in the `dep_vars` variable are printed when the simulation is run, when `create_dynamics_simulator()` is called.
Do pay attention that converting to an `ndarray` using the `result2array()` utility will shift these indexes because the first column (index 0) will then be the times.
